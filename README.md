# EventEase-ideathon-
This repository contains all the HTML and CSS file involved in the making of a sample website.
Please note the following...
This is only a sample website made plainly through HTML and CSS.
Firstly, The cards on the home page have no functionality yet.
Secondly, only the second slide of the carousel has functionality.
In the menu, The "EventEase" and "host an event" have functionality.

Thank you for reviewing our project.
